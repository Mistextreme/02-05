# 🚛💨 Distortionz Trucking

**Premium freight trucking job for FiveM / Qbox.**
A polished, feature-rich script where players take freight contracts from a depot dispatcher, hook up a real trailer with a real truck, deliver weighted cargo across the map, and earn clean money — complete with cargo manifest paperwork for police pull-overs.

## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Depot Job System
- 🤝 Underground dispatcher ped with `ox_target` interaction
- 🗺️ Configurable depot location with map blip
- 🔒 Cooldown tracking per player between deliveries
- 🚫 Anti-spam protection (one active run per player)
- ⏱️ 15-minute time limit (configurable)

### 🚛 Realistic Trailer Hookup
- 🎯 Truck spawns at one location, trailer at another
- 🔄 Player must back the truck into the trailer to attach
- 🚫 No magic snap-on — the 5th wheel must physically connect
- 🔓 Truck spawns unlocked with auto-key grant via `vehiclekeys:client:SetOwner`
- 🛡️ Auto-defeats `qbx_smallresources` lock attempts during the run
- 🧹 Both truck + trailer despawn cleanly on delivery

### 📦 Tiered Weighted Cargo
- 🎲 Random cargo type rolled on each pickup based on rarity:

| Tier | Cargo | Chance | Base Pay | Damage Penalty |
|------|-------|--------|----------|----------------|
| 🥫 Common | Food Supplies | 50% | $350 | 0.7× |
| 📦 Standard | Electronics | 30% | $600 | 0.5× |
| ☣️ Risky | Hazardous Materials | 15% | $950 | 0.4× |
| 🔒 Premium | Classified Freight | 5% | $1,500 | 0.3× |

### 🗺️ 8 Random Drop-off Locations
- Paleto Bay Warehouse
- Sandy Shores Storage
- LSIA Freight Hub
- Paleto Distribution
- Grapeseed Depot
- Mount Chiliad Outpost
- Vespucci Cargo
- Cypress Flats Yard

### 💎 Glassy NUI Panel
- 🟡 Pulsing yellow dot status indicator
- ⏱️ Live countdown timer with **amber → red blinking** warning states
- 🏷️ Animated stage pill — `PICKUP` → `IN TRANSIT` → `DELIVERED`
- 📦 Cargo + drop-off shown live
- 🟡 Full manifest section with ID, container, weight, shipper, consignee
- 💰 Live payout display

### 📋 Cargo Manifest Paperwork (RP Touch)
Players receive an `ox_inventory` item containing the freight manifest as proper paperwork. When a cop pulls them over, they hand over the manifest and the cop hovers it to read all the details.

Each manifest randomly generates:
- 🆔 **Manifest ID** (`DZ-FRT-XXXXXX`)
- 📋 **ISO 6346 container number** (4 letters + 7 digits)
- ⚖️ **Realistic gross weight** per cargo class
- 🏢 **Random shipper** (Maze Bank Logistics, Vinewood Imports, Sprunk, Whiz Wireless, etc.)
- 🏪 **Random consignee** (Burger Shot, Pisswasser, eCola, Schlongberg Sachs, etc.)
- 📍 **Destination warehouse**
- 🕒 **Issue timestamp**
- 🏷️ **Carrier**: San Andreas Freight Co.

All metadata fields render as labeled tooltip rows when the cop hovers the item.

### 👮 Police Integration
- 🚨 Configurable inspection alert chances per cargo tier:
  - Food: 0%
  - Electronics: 0%
  - Hazmat: 12%
  - Classified: 25%
- 📡 Real-time blips on cop maps with flashing effect
- 🚓 Supports `police`, `sheriff`, `sasp` jobs (configurable)

### 💸 Damage-Based Pay Penalty
- ⚠️ Trailer health below 700 HP triggers a multiplier penalty
- 🎯 Penalty severity scales with cargo type (hazmat/classified hit harder)
- 🚫 Trailer destruction = run cancelled

### 🛡️ Anti-Exploit Protection
- ✅ Server validates dropoff distance (≤25m)
- ✅ Cooldown enforced server-side (30s between runs)
- ✅ Single active job per player
- ✅ Player abandons trailer (>150m on foot) = run cancelled
- ✅ Time limit enforced
- ✅ Manifest auto-cleans on delivery, cancel, and disconnect

### 🧾 Standardized Version Checker
- 📡 GitHub `version.json` polling on resource start
- 🔍 HTML-response detection (catches misconfigured URLs)
- 🆔 Custom User-Agent (avoids GitHub rate limits)
- 🟢 Color-coded console output
